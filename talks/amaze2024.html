						<p>Good afternoon, everyone!</p>

						<p>My name is Casilda de Zulueta, Casi, I'm a technical artist, animator and indie developer, I work for the Berlin State Library on a wonderful digitalization project, and this is my 5 minute rant about the compartmentalization of knowledge, or how I wish humanities had not been removed from scientific specializations.</p>

						<p>The following slides have no direct relation to what I'm about to say, only that all of these images are of self creation. Unfinished projects and projects in the making, that I'm doing for the sake of it, and contain no traces of AI generated material.</p>

						<p>All systems have a mythos, a set of beliefs that sustains the status quo, and today's system, since the consolidation of the industrial revolution, among other things relies on the idea that arts and technique, humanities and science, are two incompatible blocks of knowledge, and that one is more useful than the other.</p>

						<p>But useful for what? And useful to whom?</p>

						<p>Learn enough about the machine to execute your tasks and pass it to the next one. That takes some time and requires some specialization. Now, where does the machine come from? Where were its components extracted from? How did it end up becoming this machine? What's the technological development that had to happen for it to exist? How many people, in how many places got involved in its production? How has it been used in the past? And for what purpose are you working with it? Sociology, history, politics, economy, literature, arts, philosophy... that could be a good start to get some of the answers.</p>

						<p>I have to say, the hability to ask why is not going to give you a job. At most, it will make you the court's jester, an entertaining inquisitor for the sake of provoquing thoughts, but no material change. And by no material change I mean that if you individually are wondering about the meaning or ethics behind the things you're told to do, tomorrow you will still be doing the exact same job, but now with this existential contradiction between producing something and being dispossesed of that something.</p>

						<p>So why should you put yourself through the trouble?</p>

						<p>Let's say you do the effort. You learn about the context and conditions of your work and your surroundings, about the cultural legacy of your medium, in my case video games, about other media preceding this one... a bit of philosophy, a bit of history, a bit of sociology.</p>

						<p>Maybe you realize that your individual condition is not that unique, that the machine is not using you, but the owner of that machine, that your time in this world is too precious and life is something more than what your CV says about you, that your value as a human being cannot be summarized. Yours and the rest of your colleague's. Maybe you decide collectively that you want more pay for your hour dedicated to that machine. Maybe you want to work less hours and continue being able to pay rent. In that new free time that you could fight for together, you could find new ways of existing.</p>

						<p>I think if you look at it that way, it's not so odd to both know C++ and Marx, right?</p>
