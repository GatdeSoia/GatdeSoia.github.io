Diegesis

From the greek διήγησις. It means: exposition, explanation, tale (in contraposition to mimesis, which means show, enactment, play).

Gerald Prince:
"The (fictional) world in which the situations and events narrated occur."

Gérard Genette

"The space-time universe of the narrated story."

"Everything that belongs to the imaginary universe from which the story or tale emerges"

"This diegetic universe is infinitely bigger than what the cinematographic piece itself is showing."

"It is here [in the diegesis], where we find all the necessary elements to make the story understandable."


Extradiegesis

Everything that goes beyond that universe.
